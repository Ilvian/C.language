Basic Concepts

* Fundamental Concepts

1. Explain the concept of a function in C programming and elaborate on its significance
in software development

- A mini-program inside a bigger program.
- Does a specific job.
- Reusability: Use the same job many times.
- Organization: Keep the program neat and tidy.
- Understandability: Easier to read and follow.
- Testing: Easier to find and fix mistakes.
- Collaboration: Helps teams work together.

Example:
int add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

In this example, the add function adds two numbers (a and b).
You can use it whenever you need to add numbers in your program.
It makes your code more organized and understandable.

2. Differentiate between 'for' and 'while' loops in C. When would you use one over the other?

'for' Loop:

- Structure: for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
Use When:
- Known number of iterations.
- Loop control in one line.
- Iterating over a range.
- Specific number of repetitions.

- Example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
        	printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
	}
    	return 0;
}

'while' Loop:

- Structure: while (condition)
Use When:
- Unknown number of iterations.
- Loop control inside loop body.
- Dynamic termination conditions.
- Reading data until a condition is met.

- Example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int x = 0;

	while (x < 5)
	{
        	printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);
        	x++;
    	}
    	return 0;
}

Choose 'for' when you know how many times to repeat, and 'while' when you're uncertain or need more flexible control.

3. How does recursion work in C, and what are its advantages and limitations?

- Function Calls Itself: In recursion, a function can call itself.
- Base Case: It's a condition that tells the function when to stop calling itself.
- It's like an exit point for the recursion.
- Recursive Case: This is where the function calls itself but with a smaller or simpler problem.

Advantages:

- Elegance: Recursion makes your code more elegant and easier to understand for certain problems.
- Solves Complex Problems: It simplifies complex problems by breaking them into smaller parts.
- Versatile: You can use recursion to solve various problems, like sorting or traversing trees.

Limitations:

- Performance: Recursive solutions can be slower because they involve function calls, which can add overhead.
- Memory Usage: Each function call consumes memory, so too many calls can lead to memory problems.
- Debugging Challenge: Debugging recursive code can be tricky because it's harder to trace the flow of execution.
- Not for All Problems: Recursion isn't suitable for every problem; some problems don't naturally lend themselves to recursion.

-Example:

#include <stdio.h>

unsigned long long factorial(int n)
{
	if (n == 0)
	{
        	return 1;
    	}
    	else
        	return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main()
{
	int n;

	printf("Enter a non-negative integer: ");
    	scanf("%d", &n);

    	if (n < 0)
	{
        	printf("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n");
    	}
	else
	{
        	unsigned long long result = factorial(n);
        	printf("Factorial of %d is %llu\n", n, result);
	}
    	return 0;
}

Remember, when using recursion, define a base case to stop it from going forever, and be cautious of memory usage and performance for deep recursions.

4. How do loops contribute to efficient program execution in C? Provide an example of a real-world scenario where using a loop is essential for solving a problem

- Repetition: Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times without the need to write the same code over and over. This reduces redundancy and helps maintain a clean and concise codebase.
- Efficiency: Instead of manually writing code for each iteration, loops automate the process, making programs more efficient and less error-prone.
- Flexibility: Loops can adapt to different input sizes or conditions, making them versatile for various tasks.
- Reduced Memory Usage: With loops, you can work with data structures like arrays and lists without the need to allocate memory and write code for each element individually.

- Example:

Scenario: Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int numbers[] = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25};
    	int sum = 0;

    	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        	sum += numbers[i];

    	double average = (double)sum / 5;

	printf("Average: %.2lf\n", average);
    	return 0;
}

In this example, the loop iterates through the numbers array, adding each element to the sum variable.
Regardless of the size of the numbers array, the loop will calculate the average correctly, demonstrating how loops contribute to efficiency and flexibility in programming.

5. Discuss the importance of conditional statements (e.g., if, else) in C programming. Can you explain a situation where nested conditional statements are required to solve a complex problem?

Importance of Conditional Statements in C Programming:

- Control Flow: "if" and "else" statements control program flow.
- Branching: They enable different actions based on conditions.
- Error Handling: Crucial for error detection and response.
- Complex Logic: Combine conditions for intricate decision-making.

- Example:

Scenario: Calculating final grades with different criteria.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	float scores[3];
    	char *criteria[] = {"Exam", "Homework", "Attendance"};
    	float weights[] = {0.4, 0.3, 0.1};
    	float finalGrade = 0.0;

    	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	{
        	printf("Enter %s score: ", criteria[i]);
        	scanf("%f", &scores[i]);
        
        	if (scores[i] >= 90) finalGrade += weights[i] * scores[i];
        	else if (scores[i] >= 80) finalGrade += 0.75 * weights[i] * scores[i];
        	else if (scores[i] >= 70) finalGrade += 0.5 * weights[i] * scores[i];
       		else finalGrade += 0.25 * weights[i] * scores[i];
    	}
    	printf("Final Grade: %.2f\n", finalGrade);
    	return 0;
}

Overall, conditional statements are essential for handling complex decision-making processes and controlling the program's flow in C programming, making them a fundamental building block for solving a wide range of problems.

* Open-End and Logical Questions

1. Imagine you need to create a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers. How would you approach this problem step by step, starting from understanding the requirements to writing the code?

#include <stdio.h>

float calculateAverage(int numbers[], int length)
{
	if (length == 0)
	{
        	return 0.0;
    	}
    	int sum = 0;

    	for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
	{
        	sum += numbers[i];
    	}
    	return (float)sum / length;
}

int main()
{
	int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    	int length = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]);
	float average = calculateAverage(numbers, length);

    	printf("The average is: %.2f\n", average);
    	return 0;
}

2. Suppose you're given a task to find the largest prime number less than a specific
value. Could you outline your thought process and the steps you'd take to solve this
problem programmatically?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

bool is_prime(int num)
{
	if (num < 2)
	{
        	return false; // Numbers less than 2 are not prime
    	}
    	for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++)
	{
        	if (num % i == 0)
		{
            		return false;
        	}
    	}
    	return true;
}

int largest_prime_less_than_N(int N)
{
	while (N > 2)
	{
        	N--;
        	if (is_prime(N))
		{
            	return N;
        	}
    	}
    	return -1;
}

int main()
{
	int N = 50;
    	int result = largest_prime_less_than_N(N);
    
	if (result != -1)
	{
        	printf("The largest prime less than %d is %d\n", N, result);
    	}
	else
        	printf("No prime less than %d\n", N);
    	return 0;
}

3. Let's say you're tasked with implementing a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). What would be your high-level approach, and how would you break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>

int is_palindrome(const char *str)
{
	int left = 0;
    	int right = strlen(str) - 1;

    	while (left < right)
	{
        	while (!isalnum(str[left]))
		{
            		left++;
        	}
        	while (!isalnum(str[right]))
		{
            		right--;
        	}
        	char left_char = tolower(str[left]);
       		char right_char = tolower(str[right]);

        	if (left_char != right_char)
		{
            		return 0;
        	}
        	left++;
        	right--;
    	}
    	return 1;
}

int main()
{
	const char *str1 = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama";
    	const char *str2 = "racecar";
    	const char *str3 = "hello";

    	printf("%d\n", is_palindrome(str1)); // 1 (True)
    	printf("%d\n", is_palindrome(str2)); // 1 (True)
    	printf("%d\n", is_palindrome(str3)); // 0 (False)

    	return 0;
}

4. You're working on a team project, and you need to integrate your code with a colleague's code. Describe your approach to ensure smooth collaboration, avoid conflicts, and verify that the integrated code works correctly.

- Communication: Discuss goals and expectations.
- Version Control: Use Git for code management.
- Code Review: Thoroughly review code for issues.
- Branching: Create a dedicated integration branch.

- CI/CD: Automate build and test processes.
- Documentation: Update project docs.
- Feedback: Encourage team feedback and iteration.
- Rollback Plan: Prepare for potential issues.
- Stakeholder Communication: Keep stakeholders informed.

- Post-Integration Review: Assess integration success.
- Security and Compliance: Ensure requirements are met.
- Deployment: Merge and deploy to production.

* Coding Challenges

1. Implement a function that reverses a string in C. Explain the time and space complexity of your solution.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void reverseString(char *str)
{
	int length = strlen(str);
    	int left = 0;
    	int right = length - 1;

    	while (left < right)
	{
        	char temp = str[left];
        	str[left] = str[right];
        	str[right] = temp;
        	left++;
        	right--;
    	}
}

int main()
{
	char str[] = "Hello, World!";

    	printf("Original string: %s\n", str);

    	reverseString(str);

    	printf("Reversed string: %s\n", str);
	return 0;
}

- Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this function is O(n/2), where 'n' is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through half of the string to perform the swap operations.

- Space Complexity:

The space complexity of this function is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input string's size. It only uses a few integer variables and a temporary character variable for swapping, so the space usage does not depend on the string's length.

2. Write a program in C that finds the factorial of a given positive integer using recursion. Explain how the recursive function works and why it terminates.

#include <stdio.h>

unsigned long long factorial(int n)
{
	if (n == 0)
	{
        	return 1;
    	}
    	return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main()
{
	int num;
    
    	printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
    	scanf("%d", &num);
    
    	if (num < 0)
	{
        	printf("Factorial is undefined for negative numbers.\n");
    	}
	else
	{
        	unsigned long long result = factorial(num);
        	printf("Factorial of %d is %llu\n", num, result);
    	}
    	return 0;
}

The recursive function terminates because it reduces the value of n with each recursive call, and it eventually reaches the base case where n equals 0. Once the base case is reached, the function starts returning values and unwinding the call stack, ultimately providing the final result.

3. Write a C program to find the sum of all even numbers from 1 to N, where N is a user-defined positive integer. Explain your code's logic and how you handle user input.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int N;
    	int sum = 0;

    	printf("Enter a positive integer N: ");
    	scanf("%d", &N);

    	if (N <= 0)
	{
        	printf("Please enter a positive integer.\n");
        	return 1;
    	}
    	for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
	{
        	if (i % 2 == 0)
		{
            		sum += i;
        	}
    	}

}

4. Implement a C function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. Explain the logic behind your code and provide test cases to verify its correctness.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>

int is_palindrome(const char *str)
{
	int left = 0;
    	int right = strlen(str) - 1;

    	while (left < right)
	{
        	while (!isalnum(str[left]))
		{
            		left++;
        	}
        	while (!isalnum(str[right]))
		{
            		right--;
        	}
        	char left_char = tolower(str[left]);
       		char right_char = tolower(str[right]);

        	if (left_char != right_char)
		{
            		return 0;
        	}
        	left++;
        	right--;
    	}
    	return 1;
}

int main()
{
	const char *str1 = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama";
    	const char *str2 = "racecar";
    	const char *str3 = "hello";

    	printf("%d\n", is_palindrome(str1));
    	printf("%d\n", is_palindrome(str2));
    	printf("%d\n", is_palindrome(str3));

    	return 0;
}

5. Implement a C program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms. Explain the concept of the Fibonacci sequence and how your program generates it.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int n, i;
    	long long int term1 = 0, term2 = 1, nextTerm;

    	printf("Enter the number of terms: ");
    	scanf("%d", &n);

    	if (n <= 0)
	{
        	printf("Please enter a positive integer.\n");
        	return 1;
    	}
    	printf("Fibonacci Sequence up to %d terms:\n", n);
    	printf("%lld, %lld, ", term1, term2);

    	for (i = 2; i < n; i++)
	{
        	nextTerm = term1 + term2;
        	printf("%lld, ", nextTerm);
        	term1 = term2;
        	term2 = nextTerm;
    	}
    	printf("\n");
    	return 0;
}

6. Write a C function to sort an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm. Explain how the algorithm works and its time complexity. Include a demonstration of the sorting function with sample input data.

#include <stdio.h>

void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n)
{
	int temp;
    	int swapped;

    	for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
	{
        	swapped = 0;
        	for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
		{
			if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
			{
                		temp = arr[j];
                		arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                		arr[j + 1] = temp;
                		swapped = 1;
            		}
        	}
        	if (swapped == 0)
		{
			break;
        	}
    	}
}

int main()
{
	int arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
    	int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    	printf("Original array: ");
    	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
        	printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    	}
    	printf("\n");

    	bubbleSort(arr, n);

    	printf("Sorted array: ");
    	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
        	printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    	}
    	printf("\n");
    	return 0;
}

Algorithms and Data Structures

* Searching and Sorting Algorithms

1. Can you explain the concept of binary search and give an example of how it is used to search for an element in a sorted array?

- Imagine you have a big list of items, but it's neatly sorted from small to big.
- You don't start looking from the beginning or randomly. Instead, you open the book somewhere in the middle.
- You look at the item in the middle and compare it with what you're searching for. If it's a match, great! You found it!
- If it's not a match, you use the information to your advantage. If the item in the middle is bigger than what you're looking for, you know the thing you want is not in the bigger half of the list. So, you throw away that bigger half and only focus on the smaller half.
- Then, you repeat steps 2 to 4 with the smaller half. You keep doing this over and over, cutting your search area in half each time.
- Eventually, you'll either find the item you're looking for, or you'll figure out that it's not in the list.

#include <stdio.h>

int binary_search(int arr[], int size, int target)
{
	int left = 0;
    	int right = size - 1;

    	while (left <= right)
	{
        	int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        	if (arr[mid] == target)
		{
            		return mid;
        	}
		else if (arr[mid] < target)
		{
            		left = mid + 1;
        	}
		else
		{
            		right = mid - 1;
        	}
    	}
    	return -1;
}

int main()
{
	int sorted_array[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16};
    	int target = 10;
    	int size = sizeof(sorted_array) / sizeof(sorted_array[0]);
    
    	int result = binary_search(sorted_array, size, target);
    
    	if (result != -1)
	{
        	printf("Element %d found at index %d\n", target, result);
    	}
	else
	{
        	printf("Element %d not found in the array\n", target);
    	}
    	return 0;
}

2. What is bubble sort and how does it work? Can you provide an example of its implementation in an array?

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list of elements (usually an array) and compares adjacent elements. If the elements are in the wrong order, they are swapped. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. Bubble sort gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list while larger elements "sink" to the bottom.

#include <stdio.h>
#include "sort.h"

void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size)
{
	size_t i, j;
    	int temp;

    	if (array == NULL || size == 0)
        	return;

    	for (i = 0; i < size - 1; i++)
    	{
        	for (j = 0; j < size - 1 - i; j++)
        	{
            		if (array[j] > array[j + 1])
            		{
                		temp = array[j];
                		array[j] = array[j + 1];
                		array[j + 1] = temp;
            		}
        	}
    	}
}

3. Can you explain the concept of selection sort and give an example of how it is used to sort an array?

Selection sort is like finding the smallest item in a list and putting it at the front. Repeat this until the list is sorted.

- Example:
Unsorted list: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

- Find the smallest (11) and put it first.
- Find the next smallest (12) and put it next.
- Repeat until done: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
- Keep selecting and placing the smallest item until the whole list is sorted.

#include <stdio.h>

void selectionSort(int arr[], int n)
{
	int i, j, minIndex, temp;

    	for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
	{
        	minIndex = i;
        	for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
		{
            		if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex])
			{
                	minIndex = j;
            		}
        	}
        	temp = arr[i];
        	arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
        	arr[minIndex] = temp;
    	}
}

int main()
{
	int arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
    	int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    	selectionSort(arr, n);

    	printf("Sorted array: ");
    	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
        	printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    	}
    	return 0;
}

4. Can you explain how quicksort works and give an example of its implementation in an array?

- Choose a Pivot: Select a pivot element from the array. The choice of pivot can affect the algorithm's performance. Common choices include the first element, the last element, or a random element.
- Partitioning: Rearrange the elements in the array so that all elements less than the pivot are on the left, and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right. The pivot itself is in its final sorted position. This process is often called the "partition" step.
- Recursion: Recursively apply quicksort to the sub-arrays on the left and right of the pivot until the entire array is sorted. This is the divide-and-conquer part of the algorithm.
- Combine: No additional combining or merging step is necessary in quicksort because the elements are sorted in place during the partitioning step.

#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int* a, int* b)
{
	int t = *a;
    	*a = *b;
    	*b = t;
}

int partition(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
	int pivot = arr[high];
    	int i = low - 1;

    	for (int j = low; j < high; j++)
	{
        	if (arr[j] <= pivot)
		{
            		i++;
            		swap(&arr[i], &arr[j]);
        	}
    	}
    	swap(&arr[i + 1], &arr[high]);
    	return i + 1;
}

void quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    	if (low < high)
	{
        	int pi = partition(arr, low, high);

	{
        	printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    	}
    	return 0;
}

5. What is merge sort and how does it work? Can you provide an example of its implementation in an array?

- Divide: Divide the unsorted array into two roughly equal halves.
- Conquer: Recursively sort both halves until each sub-array is sorted.
- Merge: Merge the two sorted sub-arrays back together to create a single, sorted array.
- Repeat steps 1-3 until the entire array is sorted.

#include <stdio.h>

void merge(int arr[], int left[], int left_size, int right[], int right_size)
{
	int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;

    	while (i < left_size && j < right_size)
	{
        	if (left[i] < right[j])
		{
            		arr[k++] = left[i++];
        	}
		else
		{
            		arr[k++] = right[j++];
        	}
    	}

    	while (i < left_size)
	{
        	arr[k++] = left[i++];
    	}

    	while (j < right_size)
	{
        	arr[k++] = right[j++];
    	}
}

void merge_sort(int arr[], int size)
{
	if (size <= 1)
	{
        	return;
    	}

    	int mid = size / 2;
    	int left[mid];
    	int right[size - mid];

    	for (int i = 0; i < mid; i++)
	{
        	left[i] = arr[i];
    	}

    	for (int i = mid; i < size; i++)
	{
        	right[i - mid] = arr[i];
    	}

    	merge_sort(left, mid);
    	merge_sort(right, size - mid);

    	merge(arr, left, mid, right, size - mid);
}

int main()
{
	int arr[] = {38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10};
	int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    	printf("Original array: ");
    	for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
	{
        	printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    	}

    	merge_sort(arr, size);

    	printf("\nSorted array: ");
    	for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
	{
        	printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    	}

    	return 0;
}

6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort algorithms? How do their time complexities compare?

- Bubble Sort:

Advantages:
Simple to understand and implement.
Requires very little additional memory, as it only needs a constant amount of extra space.

Disadvantages:
Inefficient for large lists; its time complexity is poor.
Performs poorly on almost-sorted or partially-sorted data, as it doesn't take advantage of existing order.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where n is the number of elements to be sorted. In the best case (when the input is already sorted), it can be O(n).

- Selection Sort:

Advantages:
Simple to implement.
Requires minimal extra memory like Bubble Sort.

Disadvantages:
Inefficient for large lists; it has a poor time complexity.
Like Bubble Sort, it doesn't perform well on nearly sorted data.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst, average, and best cases. This makes it inefficient for large datasets.

- Insertion Sort:

Advantages:
Simple to understand and implement.
Performs well on small datasets or nearly sorted data.
It's an adaptive algorithm, meaning it becomes more efficient when sorting partially ordered data.

Disadvantages:
Still inefficient for large lists compared to more advanced algorithms like merge sort or quicksort.
Time Complexity:
Worst-case: O(n^2)
Average-case: O(n^2)
Best-case: O(n) when the input is already sorted or nearly sorted.

- Conclusion:
Use them for small datasets or nearly sorted data.
For large datasets, prefer more efficient algorithms like merge sort or quicksort (O(n log n)).

7. Can you compare the time and space complexities of quick sort and merge sort algorithms? Under what conditions is one more suitable than the other?

Quick Sort:
- Time Complexity: O(n log n) average/best, O(n^2) worst
- Space Complexity: O(log n) average, O(n) worst
- In-place sorting
- Not stable
- Efficient for random data and limited memory

Merge Sort:
- Time Complexity: O(n log n) for all cases
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Stable sorting
- Consistent performance
- Suitable for worst-case scenarios and when stability is essential

* Data Structures

1. How are arrays implemented and what are the advantages and disadvantages of
using arrays over other data structures?

Arrays are fundamental data structures used in computer science and programming. They are a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. Arrays are implemented in various ways depending on the programming language and the underlying memory management system, but here's a general overview of how they are typically implemented and their advantages and disadvantages.

Implementation of Arrays:

- Contiguous Memory Allocation: In most programming languages, arrays are implemented using contiguous memory allocation. This means that all elements of the array are stored in a single block of memory, and they are accessed using their indices.

- Fixed Size: Arrays usually have a fixed size, which is determined at the time of declaration. Changing the size of an array is often not straightforward and may involve creating a new larger array and copying the elements from the old array to the new one.

- Homogeneous Elements: Arrays typically store elements of the same data type. For example, an array can store integers, floating-point numbers, or characters, but all elements must be of the same type.

Advantages of Arrays:
- Fast Access Time
- Memory Efficiency
- Simple and Predictable
- Efficient Element Iteration

Disadvantages of Arrays:
- Fixed Size
- Wasted Memory
- Inefficient Insertions and Deletions
- Homogeneous Data Type
- Not Suitable for Dynamic Data

2. Can you explain the concept of a linked list and give an example of how it is used in C or Python?

A linked list is a collection of elements, called nodes, where each node contains two parts: the actual data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows you to represent a sequence of elements where each element (node) points to the next one, forming a chain-like structure.

- Singly Linked List: In a singly linked list, each node has a reference to the next node, but not to the previous one. The last node typically points to null (or None in Python) to indicate the end of the list.

- Doubly Linked List: In a doubly linked list, each node has references to both the next and the previous nodes. This allows for easier traversal in both directions, but it requires more memory to store the additional references.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};

struct Node* createNode(int data)
{
	struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    	newNode->data = data;
    	newNode->next = NULL;
    	return newNode;
}

int main()
{
	struct Node* head = createNode(1);
    	struct Node* second = createNode(2);
    	struct Node* third = createNode(3);

    	head->next = second;
    	second->next = third;

    	struct Node* current = head;
    	while (current != NULL)
	{
        	printf("%d -> ", current->data);
        	current = current->next;
    	}
    	printf("NULL\n");

    	return 0;
}

3. What are hash maps (or dictionaries) and how are they implemented? How do they compare to other data structures in terms of time complexity for insertion, deletion and search operations?

- Data structures for storing key-value pairs.
- Use a hash function to map keys to array indices.
- Efficient for average-case operations.

Time complexities:
- Insertion: O(1) on average, O(n) worst-case.
- Search: O(1) on average, O(n) worst-case.
- Deletion: O(1) on average, O(n) worst-case.

Comparison with Other Data Structures
- Hash Maps vs. Trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black):
- Hash maps have faster average-case performance.
- Trees have predictable worst-case O(log n) performance.
- Choose based on application requirements.

4. Can you explain the concept of a queue and give an example of how it is implemented?

Queue is a linear data structure that follows the "First-In-First-Out" (FIFO) principle. In simpler terms, the first item added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Imagine a real-world queue of people waiting in line; the person who arrives first is the one to be served first.

A queue has two primary operations:

- Enqueue: This operation is used to add an item to the back of the queue. It's akin to a person joining the line at the end.
- Dequeue: This operation is used to remove an item from the front of the queue, simulating the process of serving the first person in line.

Queues are widely used in computer science and programming for various purposes, including managing tasks, scheduling processes, and implementing various algorithms.

#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 5

int queue[MAX_SIZE];
int front = -1;
int rear = -1;

void enqueue(int item)
{
	if (rear == MAX_SIZE - 1)
	{
        	printf("Queue is full. Cannot enqueue.\n");
        	return;
    	}
    	if (front == -1)
	{
        	front = 0;
    	}
    	rear++;
    	queue[rear] = item;
}

int dequeue()
{
	if (front == -1)
	{
        	printf("Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue.\n");
        	return -1;
    	}
    	int item = queue[front];
    	front++;
    	if (front > rear)
	{
        	front = rear = -1;
    	}
    	return item;
}

int main()
{
	enqueue(1);
    	enqueue(2);
    	enqueue(3);

    	printf("Dequeued item: %d\n", dequeue());

    	return 0;
}

5. What is a stack data structure and how is it implemented? How does it differ from a queue and when is it more suitable to use a stack over a queue?

Stack:
- Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
- Implemented using arrays or linked lists.
- Use cases: managing function calls, undo functionality, depth-first traversal.

How a stack works:
- Push: Adding an item to the top of the stack is called a "push" operation.
- Pop: Removing the item from the top of the stack is called a "pop" operation.
- Peek (or Top): Viewing the item at the top of the stack without removing it is called "peeking."
- Empty: Checking if the stack is empty.

Queue:
- First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
- Implemented using arrays or linked lists.
- Use cases: task scheduling, breadth-first traversal, resource management.

How a queue works:
- Enqueue (or Push): Adding an item to the back of the queue.
- Dequeue (or Pop): Removing an item from the front of the queue.
- Front: Viewing the item at the front of the queue without removing it.
- Rear (or Back): Viewing the item at the back of the queue without removing it.

Choose between them based on whether you need LIFO or FIFO order for your data and the specific problem you're solving.
