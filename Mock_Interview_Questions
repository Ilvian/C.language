Basic Concepts

* Fundamental Concepts

1. Explain the concept of a function in C programming and elaborate on its significance
in software development

- A mini-program inside a bigger program.
- Does a specific job.
- Reusability: Use the same job many times.
- Organization: Keep the program neat and tidy.
- Understandability: Easier to read and follow.
- Testing: Easier to find and fix mistakes.
- Collaboration: Helps teams work together.

Example:
int add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

In this example, the add function adds two numbers (a and b).
You can use it whenever you need to add numbers in your program.
It makes your code more organized and understandable.

2. Differentiate between 'for' and 'while' loops in C. When would you use one over the other?

'for' Loop:

- Structure: for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
Use When:
- Known number of iterations.
- Loop control in one line.
- Iterating over a range.
- Specific number of repetitions.

- Example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
        	printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
	}
    	return 0;
}

'while' Loop:

- Structure: while (condition)
Use When:
- Unknown number of iterations.
- Loop control inside loop body.
- Dynamic termination conditions.
- Reading data until a condition is met.

- Example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int x = 0;

	while (x < 5)
	{
        	printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);
        	x++;
    	}
    	return 0;
}

Choose 'for' when you know how many times to repeat, and 'while' when you're uncertain or need more flexible control.

3. How does recursion work in C, and what are its advantages and limitations?

- Function Calls Itself: In recursion, a function can call itself.
- Base Case: It's a condition that tells the function when to stop calling itself.
- It's like an exit point for the recursion.
- Recursive Case: This is where the function calls itself but with a smaller or simpler problem.

Advantages:

- Elegance: Recursion makes your code more elegant and easier to understand for certain problems.
- Solves Complex Problems: It simplifies complex problems by breaking them into smaller parts.
- Versatile: You can use recursion to solve various problems, like sorting or traversing trees.

Limitations:

- Performance: Recursive solutions can be slower because they involve function calls, which can add overhead.
- Memory Usage: Each function call consumes memory, so too many calls can lead to memory problems.
- Debugging Challenge: Debugging recursive code can be tricky because it's harder to trace the flow of execution.
- Not for All Problems: Recursion isn't suitable for every problem; some problems don't naturally lend themselves to recursion.

-Example:

#include <stdio.h>

unsigned long long factorial(int n)
{
	if (n == 0)
	{
        	return 1;
    	}
    	else
        	return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main()
{
	int n;

	printf("Enter a non-negative integer: ");
    	scanf("%d", &n);

    	if (n < 0)
	{
        	printf("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n");
    	}
	else
	{
        	unsigned long long result = factorial(n);
        	printf("Factorial of %d is %llu\n", n, result);
	}
    	return 0;
}

Remember, when using recursion, define a base case to stop it from going forever, and be cautious of memory usage and performance for deep recursions.

4. How do loops contribute to efficient program execution in C? Provide an example of a real-world scenario where using a loop is essential for solving a problem

- Repetition: Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times without the need to write the same code over and over. This reduces redundancy and helps maintain a clean and concise codebase.
- Efficiency: Instead of manually writing code for each iteration, loops automate the process, making programs more efficient and less error-prone.
- Flexibility: Loops can adapt to different input sizes or conditions, making them versatile for various tasks.
- Reduced Memory Usage: With loops, you can work with data structures like arrays and lists without the need to allocate memory and write code for each element individually.

- Example:

Scenario: Calculating the Average of a List of Numbers

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int numbers[] = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25};
    	int sum = 0;

    	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        	sum += numbers[i];

    	double average = (double)sum / 5;

	printf("Average: %.2lf\n", average);
    	return 0;
}

In this example, the loop iterates through the numbers array, adding each element to the sum variable.
Regardless of the size of the numbers array, the loop will calculate the average correctly, demonstrating how loops contribute to efficiency and flexibility in programming.

5. Discuss the importance of conditional statements (e.g., if, else) in C programming. Can you explain a situation where nested conditional statements are required to solve a complex problem?

Importance of Conditional Statements in C Programming:

- Control Flow: "if" and "else" statements control program flow.
- Branching: They enable different actions based on conditions.
- Error Handling: Crucial for error detection and response.
- Complex Logic: Combine conditions for intricate decision-making.

- Example:

Scenario: Calculating final grades with different criteria.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	float scores[3];
    	char *criteria[] = {"Exam", "Homework", "Attendance"};
    	float weights[] = {0.4, 0.3, 0.1};
    	float finalGrade = 0.0;

    	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	{
        	printf("Enter %s score: ", criteria[i]);
        	scanf("%f", &scores[i]);
        
        	if (scores[i] >= 90) finalGrade += weights[i] * scores[i];
        	else if (scores[i] >= 80) finalGrade += 0.75 * weights[i] * scores[i];
        	else if (scores[i] >= 70) finalGrade += 0.5 * weights[i] * scores[i];
       		else finalGrade += 0.25 * weights[i] * scores[i];
    	}
    	printf("Final Grade: %.2f\n", finalGrade);
    	return 0;
}

Overall, conditional statements are essential for handling complex decision-making processes and controlling the program's flow in C programming, making them a fundamental building block for solving a wide range of problems.

* Open-End and Logical Questions

1. Imagine you need to create a program that calculates the average of a list of numbers. How would you approach this problem step by step, starting from understanding the requirements to writing the code?

#include <stdio.h>

float calculateAverage(int numbers[], int length)
{
	if (length == 0)
	{
        	return 0.0;
    	}
    	int sum = 0;

    	for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
	{
        	sum += numbers[i];
    	}
    	return (float)sum / length;
}

int main()
{
	int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    	int length = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]);
	float average = calculateAverage(numbers, length);

    	printf("The average is: %.2f\n", average);
    	return 0;
}

2. Suppose you're given a task to find the largest prime number less than a specific
value. Could you outline your thought process and the steps you'd take to solve this
problem programmatically?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

bool is_prime(int num)
{
	if (num < 2)
	{
        	return false; // Numbers less than 2 are not prime
    	}
    	for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++)
	{
        	if (num % i == 0)
		{
            		return false;
        	}
    	}
    	return true;
}

int largest_prime_less_than_N(int N)
{
	while (N > 2)
	{
        	N--;
        	if (is_prime(N))
		{
            	return N;
        	}
    	}
    	return -1;
}

int main()
{
	int N = 50;
    	int result = largest_prime_less_than_N(N);
    
	if (result != -1)
	{
        	printf("The largest prime less than %d is %d\n", N, result);
    	}
	else
        	printf("No prime less than %d\n", N);
    	return 0;
}

3. Let's say you're tasked with implementing a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). What would be your high-level approach, and how would you break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>

int is_palindrome(const char *str)
{
	int left = 0;
    	int right = strlen(str) - 1;

    	while (left < right)
	{
        	while (!isalnum(str[left]))
		{
            		left++;
        	}
        	while (!isalnum(str[right]))
		{
            		right--;
        	}
        	char left_char = tolower(str[left]);
       		char right_char = tolower(str[right]);

        	if (left_char != right_char)
		{
            		return 0;
        	}
        	left++;
        	right--;
    	}
    	return 1;
}

int main()
{
	const char *str1 = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama";
    	const char *str2 = "racecar";
    	const char *str3 = "hello";

    	printf("%d\n", is_palindrome(str1)); // 1 (True)
    	printf("%d\n", is_palindrome(str2)); // 1 (True)
    	printf("%d\n", is_palindrome(str3)); // 0 (False)

    	return 0;
}

* Coding Challenges

1. Implement a function that reverses a string in C. Explain the time and space complexity of your solution.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void reverseString(char *str)
{
	int length = strlen(str);
    	int left = 0;
    	int right = length - 1;

    	while (left < right)
	{
        	char temp = str[left];
        	str[left] = str[right];
        	str[right] = temp;
        	left++;
        	right--;
    	}
}

int main()
{
	char str[] = "Hello, World!";

    	printf("Original string: %s\n", str);

    	reverseString(str);

    	printf("Reversed string: %s\n", str);
	return 0;
}

- Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this function is O(n/2), where 'n' is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through half of the string to perform the swap operations.

- Space Complexity:

The space complexity of this function is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input string's size. It only uses a few integer variables and a temporary character variable for swapping, so the space usage does not depend on the string's length.

2. Write a program in C that finds the factorial of a given positive integer using recursion. Explain how the recursive function works and why it terminates.

#include <stdio.h>

unsigned long long factorial(int n)
{
	if (n == 0)
	{
        	return 1;
    	}
    	return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main()
{
	int num;
    
    	printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
    	scanf("%d", &num);
    
    	if (num < 0)
	{
        	printf("Factorial is undefined for negative numbers.\n");
    	}
	else
	{
        	unsigned long long result = factorial(num);
        	printf("Factorial of %d is %llu\n", num, result);
    	}
    	return 0;
}

The recursive function terminates because it reduces the value of n with each recursive call, and it eventually reaches the base case where n equals 0. Once the base case is reached, the function starts returning values and unwinding the call stack, ultimately providing the final result.

3. Write a C program to find the sum of all even numbers from 1 to N, where N is a user-defined positive integer. Explain your code's logic and how you handle user input.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int N;
    	int sum = 0;

    	printf("Enter a positive integer N: ");
    	scanf("%d", &N);

    	if (N <= 0)
	{
        	printf("Please enter a positive integer.\n");
        	return 1;
    	}
    	for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
	{
        	if (i % 2 == 0)
		{
            		sum += i;
        	}
    	}

}

4. Implement a C function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. Explain the logic behind your code and provide test cases to verify its correctness.
